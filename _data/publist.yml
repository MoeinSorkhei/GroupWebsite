  description: "Interval and large invasive breast cancers, which are associated with worse prog- nosis than other cancers, are usually detected at a late stage due to false negative assessments of screening mammograms. The missed screening-time detection is commonly caused by the tumor being obscured by its surrounding breast tissues, a phenomenon called masking. To study and benchmark mammographic masking of cancer, in this work we introduce CSAW-M, the largest public mammographic dataset, collected from over 10,000 individuals and annotated with potential mask- ing. In contrast to the previous approaches which measure breast image density as a proxy, our dataset directly provides annotations of masking potential assess- ments from five specialists. We also trained deep learning models on CSAW-M to estimate the masking level and showed that the estimated masking is significantly more predictive of screening participants diagnosed with interval and large invasive cancers – without being explicitly trained for these tasks – than its breast density counterparts."

- title: "Is it Time to Replace CNNs with Transformers for Medical Images?"
  image: "dummy.png"
  description: "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have reigned for a decade as the de facto approach to automated medical image diagnosis. Recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have appeared as a competitive alternative to CNNs, yielding similar levels of performance while possessing several interesting properties that could prove beneficial for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we explore whether it is time to move to transformer-based models or if we should keep working with CNNs - can we trivially switch to transformers? If so, what are the advantages and drawbacks of switching to ViTs for medical image diagnosis? We consider these questions in a series of experiments on three mainstream medical image datasets. Our findings show that, while CNNs perform better when trained from scratch, off-the-shelf vision transformers using default hyperparameters are on par with CNNs when pretrained on ImageNet, and outperform their CNN counterparts when pretrained using self-supervision."
